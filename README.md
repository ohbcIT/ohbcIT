- 👋 Hi, we are @ohbcIT - we are volunteers at Oak Hills Baptist Church in Sioux Falls, South Dakota
- 👀 We use a lot of FOSS in our Church.  OBS, QLC+, VLC, Handbrake etc.  We thought we might share how we do this so others might benefit.
- 🌱 We are currently learning how we might replace ProPresenter with OpenLP
- 💞️ We are looking to collaborate on projecs that might help other Churches fulfill their mission.
- 📫 How to reach us - We are exploring github for this purpose ATM and we are volunteers - so we are not sure how active we will be here.
